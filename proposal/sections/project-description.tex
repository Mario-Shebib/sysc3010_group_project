About Us:
  As COVID-19 concerns bring everyday life all over the world to a standstill, our team consisting of Carleton Engineering students, works towards tackelling these challenges and make life easier for consumers everywhere.

The Team Project 

  As Governments proceed to re-open workplaces, how effective are the risk management protocols implemented by employers? Are employers prepared for the employees to come back? How can we be more aware and not panic in implementing proper entry way guidelines to eliminate the risk of COVID-19? As consumers around the world face these challenges everyday, our team works towards providing the ultimate solution to following proper call-in procedures. We bring to you a system that looks after the well being of your employees and follows government regulated infection prevention policies, practices and guidelines for workplaces. 

  This Project will be designed to meet the needs of the employers to look after the safety of their employees. Our groundbreaking access control system complies with employer standards and provides employees access to a COVID-19 free workplace. As studies show that fever (< 39.1 °C) is the most frequent symptom in more than 50% of COVID-19 cases [1], our system prevents entry to employees that present symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, our system adheres to social distancing guidelines implied by the government and restricts access to reduce the spread of COVID-19. With many more features and benefits, implementing our system at workplaces around the world, successfully helps in providing a COVID-19 free work environment for employees.

- Recognize the employee based on their NFC security card presented to the reader 
- Measure the body temperature of an employee trying to enter the work premises 
- Prevent access to employees with body temperature over 39.1 °C
- Keep track of employee details such as their body temperature measurement for last 14 days, based on a unique user NFC security card user ID
- Identifies the number of people in the premises 
- Dispalys a red light at the entrance to restricts access when the maximum threshold of the premises has been acquired
