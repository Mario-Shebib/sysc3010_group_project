\subsection{Communication Between Nodes}
The door nodes will be communicating with one another using Wifi. The door nodes
do not communicate between themselves with their outputs informing the control
server which in turn can send updates to the door nodes of changes that have
occurred at other door nodes.

\subsection{Door Nodes}
The door nodes are Raspberry Pis that are set up in headless mode that will be
the front line in the protection of the secured locations that use the product.
They are connected to an NFC security badge reader, an infrared
temperature sensor and an electronic lock actuator. They will
not allow the doors to be opened if there is a full occupancy or if there is a
temperature beyond the limit set by the control server. Furthermore, if that
temperature occurs three times the control server will be given an option to set
their account to not allow them in until a quarantine period ends. An LED is set
up with each of the door nodes that will be green if not yet at full capacity
with the LED shining red if at full capacity to discourage people from
attempting to enter the door.

\subsubsection{Sensors}
The infrared temperature sensor that will be used is central to the safety of the location
and why the system exists. It will measure the temperature of the individual
without physically touching them that will be communicated to the computer which
has a program to determine if they have a fever which will not allow them to go
through the door. If the temperature is within the acceptable range it will
inform the door node to open and if it's below the acceptable range that will
currently be determined to be the ambient temperature and keep the door closed
as well. An NFC system will be used with security badges that will inform the door node
which can check if the individual should currently be in quarantine, if they
don't have a valid security badge or if there have been enough other
security badges that have been
swiped that the building is at maximum capacity.

\subsubsection{Actuator}
The door will open from an actuator that is attached to the door and will be
activated upon permission being granted by the control server. It will open with a
pressure that is set as to not hurt individuals or individuals with children if
the time they take to enter the door after it opens exceeds the default time.
This is also to prevent any theoretical people on the other side of the door
from being harmed by the door swinging open.

\subsection{Control Server}
The control server will be a Raspberry Pi connected to a monitor, keyboard and
mouse. It will be where the operator of the security system can modify the
acceptable range of temperatures and view the database for themselves as well as
revoke access to those whose temperatures are at a high enough level that they
will be asked to quarantine.

\subsubsection{Database}
The database will contain the information about the individuals with valid
security badges and what the most recent result of the temperature probe was.
Also, it will indicate whether those individuals are signed into the building or
not, as well as how many individuals are currently signed into the building.

\subsubsection{Graphical User Interface}
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the control server will appear as a table
with an option to open up a pop-up to unilaterally turn on the red light for any
of the door nodes as well as a pop up to change the acceptable temperature
range. There will be a notification sidebar which will list the individuals who
have had three temperatures above the temperature range limits in a row with an
option to allow that indiviudal to have access again with an O and to not allow
them to be access for 14 days as a quarantine period with an X. In the
spreadsheet, the operator can manually override these options if it is deemed
necessary by them.
